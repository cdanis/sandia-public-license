# The Sandia Message Public License (SMPL)

The Sandia Message Public License is a *meta-license* that allows you to ship warning messages appropriate for **all** software as part of your open-source software licensing & copyright statements.  It is sublicense-compatible with most of the popular F/OSS licenses.

## How to apply the SMPL to your work

If you develop a new piece of software, and you are concerned that it might be mistaken as being of any positive utility to anyone, anywhere, the best way to warn others is to include with it a message & system of messages that steer others away.

To apply the SMPL to your work, attach the following boilerplate notice, with the fields surrounded by square brackets "**[**...**]**" replaced with your own identifying information and sublicense choice.  (Don't include the brackets!)

The text should be enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format.  We also recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included on the same "page" as the copyright notice for easier identification within third-party archives.

It is also recommended to include the below text somewhere in the user interface, whether that be via printing it on the terminal when a console program starts in interactive mode, or listing it on a console program's `--help` text, or in a GUI program's about box, or displaying it in the footer of your web application (but preferably, "above the fold" and relatively prominently).

## List of sublicense codes
Sublicense codes are the keyword abbreviations for other open source licenses listed on [Github's list of license keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository#searching-github-by-license-type).

For example, you would abbreviate a SMPL-licensed GPLv3-sublicensed program `sandia-gpl-3.0`, a SMPL-licensed MIT-sublicensed program `sandia-mit`, etc.

## Of SMPL-licensed works: Duplication, redistribution, derivative works, disclaimer of warranty, limitation of liability, grants of patent licenses, &c, &c, &c
All such concerns follow the terms of the sublicense.
